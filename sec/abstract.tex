\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
This report presents the design, development, and implementation of a comprehensive web-based brain tumor detection system utilizing deep learning techniques for medical image analysis. The system integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a modern full-stack web application to provide automated classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. The application distinguishes between four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary tumors, and Normal brain scans. Built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js/Express.js for the backend, and TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning implementation, the system demonstrates the practical application of artificial intelligence in healthcare diagnostics. The system achieves high accuracy in tumor classification while providing a user-friendly interface for medical professionals and researchers. This work contributes to the growing field of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems and demonstrates the potential of web-based AI applications in medical imaging.
