\section{Expected Output}
The expected output of this system is a deep learning-based brain tumor detection and classification tool that accurately identifies the presence and type of brain tumor specifically glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor from \gls{mri} images. The system should take a grayscale brain \gls{mri} image as input and return a prediction label along with the confidence score for each class. Additionally, the model is expected to achieve a high level of accuracy, ideally over 95\%, in both training and validation datasets. The use of transfer learning with a pretrained \gls{vgg16} model should enhance the performance, especially when working with a relatively small dataset. During deployment, the output will be presented in a user-friendly interface (using \gls{mern} stack) where users can upload an \gls{mri} image and view the classification result in real-time. Moreover, the model should generalize well to unseen data and avoid overfitting, which will be evaluated through performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization. The system will also support a structured output format (e.g., \gls{json}) for possible integration into larger medical or research systems.
